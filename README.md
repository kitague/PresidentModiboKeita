This is a  brief profile of  the First President of Republic of Mali in West Africa when Mali take his indepence in 1960. I will be updating with some new information on this website  and  it work on  progress. The website will be updated as I added more features into it. I will be adding more information about passed presidents as they become available. Information gethering is complicated in Mali.
